## Principles

These principles describe the expected way of working.

### Trust

We start collaboration with full trust. We treat each other as adults who care about outcomes, aim for high standards, and act with integrity.

Trust is the default, not a reward. It is sustained through transparency, honesty, and early communication when things drift.

### Ownership

Ownership is responsibility for outcomes, not tasks.

If something is yours, you drive it from start to finish, including unclear scope, missing inputs, decisions, and coordination with others. Ownership means you do not wait for perfect conditions, explicit permission, or someone else to unblock you.

If ownership is unclear, you are responsible for clarifying it or temporarily owning it until it is reassigned.

### Accountability

Commitments matter. We surface missed expectations early, openly, and without blame.

We hold ourselves accountable first, before being asked. Explanations do not replace results, and repeated misses matter more than isolated errors.

If you see a risk to a commitment, you raise it immediately. Silence is a failure of accountability.

### Quality Bar

We aim for excellence in everything we deliver. Deadlines and constraints do not excuse sloppy thinking or execution. If quality is reduced, it is a conscious decision with a clear owner and rationale.

## What I Expect From You

### **Thinking & Problem Solving**

- Don’t complain. When you see a problem, bring options.
- Don’t take action without understanding the value. If the “why” is unclear, clarify it.
- If you see me making a wrong call, speak up. Blind agreement helps no one.
- Prioritize the team win over the personal win.

### **Communication**

- Don’t assume. If something is unclear, ask.
- Make your work visible. Align early.
- Escalate risks before they become failures.
- Inform in advance if you can’t keep a promise. ([Learn Impeccable Coordination](https://leadcase.net/topics/impeccable-coordination)).

### **Disagreement**

- If you disagree with something, speak up about it and share arguments/facts.
- Once a decision is made, commit fully, even if it wasn’t your preferred option.

### **Team First**

- Prioritize the team win over the personal win.
- Optimize for collective outcomes, not local convenience.

## What you can expect from me

- Autonomy in doing your job
- Support when you are stuck and ask for help
- Context and reasoning behind decisions.
- Direct feedback. Early, honest, and respectful.

## **The Red Lines**

- Not asking for help when stuck.
- Withholding information. Not sharing issues.
- Chronic lateness on commitments.
- Forgetting information. Not joining meetings.
- Blaming others for outcomes instead of owning your part.
- Agreeing publicly and resisting privately.
- No passive-aggressive behavior.
